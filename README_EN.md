## System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- uv (recommended for Python environment management)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install uv (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/T1mn/MarketPulse.git
cd MarketPulse
```

### 3. Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

uv pip install -r requirements.txt

uv pip install -e .
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your API keys:

```env
# API Keys
FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Bark Keys (at least one is required)
BARK_KEY_1=your_first_bark_key
# BARK_KEY_2=your_second_bark_key

# PushPlus Token (optional)
PUSHPLUS_TOKEN=your_pushplus_token
# PushPlus Topic (optional, sends to your account if left blank)
PUSHPLUS_TOPIC=your_topic_code
```

### 5. Run the Service

```bash
# Run directly in the foreground (for debugging)
python -m MarketPulse.main

# Or run as a daemon in the background (recommended)
python -m MarketPulse.daemon_manager start
```

## Configuration Guide

### News Sources Configuration

Configure trusted news sources in `config.py`:

```python
TRUSTED_SOURCES = [
    "Reuters",
    "Bloomberg",
    "The Wall Street Journal",
    "Associated Press",
    "CNBC",
    "Dow Jones Newswires",
    "MarketWatch"
]
```

### Market Watch Configuration

Configure stock symbols to monitor:

```python
US_MARKET_SYMBOLS = [
    "SPY",    # S&P 500 ETF
    "DIA",    # Dow Jones ETF
    "QQQ",    # NASDAQ 100 ETF
    "AAPL",   # Apple
    "MSFT",   # Microsoft
    "GOOGL",  # Google
    "AMZN",   # Amazon
    "TSLA"    # Tesla
]
```

### Notification Interval Configuration

Default news check interval is 30 minutes, can be modified in `config.py`:

```python
NEWS_FETCH_INTERVAL = 30  # minutes
```

## Notification Content

Each notification includes:
- News headline
- AI analysis summary
- Market impact assessment
- Investment recommendations
- Related stock symbols
- News source link

## Important Notes

1.  **API Keys**: Ensure all required API keys are configured correctly.
2.  **Environment Management**: Using `uv` is recommended for better dependency resolution.
3.  **First Run**: The service runs a job immediately on startup, then follows the interval set in `config.py`.
4.  **State File**: Processed news IDs and notifier status (e.g., rate limits) are saved in `app_state.json` to prevent duplicate notifications and respect API limits.

## Dependencies

Main dependencies include:
- `google-generativeai`: [Google Gemini AI](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-python) interface
- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management
- `schedule`: Task scheduling
- `requests`: HTTP requests

## Contributing

- [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) - For providing high-quality financial news data API

## Service Management

### Running as a Daemon

MarketPulse supports running as a daemon service with complete process management:

```bash
# Start the service
python -m MarketPulse.daemon_manager start

# Stop the service
python -m MarketPulse.daemon_manager stop

# Restart the service
python -m MarketPulse.daemon_manager restart

# Check service status
python -m MarketPulse.daemon_manager status
```

The service will run completely in the background without occupying your terminal. You can safely close your terminal after starting the service.

### Logging System

The service uses a hierarchical logging system. All log files are stored in the `logs` directory:

- `logs/market_pulse.log`: Main application logs
- `logs/daemon.log`: Daemon process logs

Monitor logs in real-time:
```bash
# View main application logs
tail -f logs/market_pulse.log

# View daemon process logs
tail -f logs/daemon.log
```

Log files are automatically rotated:
- Main log: Maximum 10MB per file, keeps 5 backup files
- Daemon log: Maximum 5MB per file, keeps 3 backup files

### Process Management

The service maintains a PID file at `market_pulse.pid` for process management. You don't need to handle this file directly as it's managed by the daemon manager.

Key features:
- Complete detachment from terminal
- Automatic process management
- Graceful startup and shutdown
- Signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
